# Heart Disease Prediction using machine learning algorithms

this project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing using **seaborn** and **pandas** libraries
then different models were trained and  prediction are made with different algorithms Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest etc.

I have used different machine leanring algorithms, implemented in python, to predict whether the patient has heart disease or not, this is a prediction problem,
with multiple features and parameters, and target variable as a binary variable, predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient

## Machine learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

the highest accuracy achieved: **88%** (Logistic Regression)
